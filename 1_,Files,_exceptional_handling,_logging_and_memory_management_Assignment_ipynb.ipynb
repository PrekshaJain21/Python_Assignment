        "Ques 1: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 1: Interpreted languages: Code is executed line by line by an interpreter. They are slower but easier to debug and platform-independent.\n",
        "Compiled languages: Entire code is converted into machine code before execution. They are faster but less flexible across platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Example:\n",
        "Python → Interpreted.\n",
        "C/C++ → Compiled.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques 2: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 2: Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors so that the program continues execution instead of crashing.\n",
        "Uses try, except, else, and finally.\n",
        "Helps in writing secure and reliable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Example:\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = 10 / 0\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"You cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques 3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 3: The finally block executes always, whether or not an exception occurs.\n",
        "Used for cleanup tasks like closing files, releasing memory, or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Example:\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    f = open(\"test.txt\", \"r\")\n",

        "\n",
        "✅ Example:\n",
        "import logging\n",

        "Ques 5: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 5: The __del__ method is a destructor, called automatically when an object is destroyed.Used for cleanup operations (closing files, releasing memory).\n",
        "However, it’s not always guaranteed when it will be called (depends on garbage collection).\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Example:\n",
        "class Demo:\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",

        "Ques 8: What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 8:with automatically closes the file after use.It is a context manager.\n",
